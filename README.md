# Weather-Dashboard
This project is to create a web dash board for over 500 cities of the world. These were selected with help of pycity based on their latitudinal position from the earth. 
The project aims to compare different parameters of weather such as cloudiness, temperature, wind-speed precipitation etc. with regards to there distance from the earth's equator(latitude 0 degree). 
The aim is to see how different parameters are affected as we go farthur from the equator, towards the poles of the earth.
